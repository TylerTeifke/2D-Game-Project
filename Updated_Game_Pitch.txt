Elevator Pitch: “Have you ever wanted to play a Metroidvania where power-ups used for exploration are also integrated into combat, then you should play our game. Our game will feature a variety of distinct abilities that will not only offer ways of traversing an interconnected world map, but will also serve as the backbone of the game’s combat system.”

Synopsis: This is a Metroidvania game where the player is encouraged to explore the map in order to find power ups. Power ups will make it so the player is able to traverse more of the game world as well as making the player better at combat. The game uses a medieval fantasy aesthetic because we felt that it fit the concept of exploring a large game world and defeating monsters.

Objective: The objective of the final game is to explore the world map to find all of the power ups in order to become powerful enough to escape. For this prototype the main objective is to collect all of the collectables.

Mechanics: The main mechanics of the game would be the abilities that the player receives from power ups that will be used for combat and exploration. These abilities would be a forward slash with your sword that could be used for getting past large horizontal gaps, an upward slash used to get to high up places, and a downward slash that could be used to break blocks beneath the player. While these abilities will be able to hurt enemies in the final game, for this prototype, they do no damage. The player can defeat enemies by slashing at them with a basic attack. Finally, in order to encourage exploration, there would be power ups littered throughout the game world that would increase the player’s health if collected.
